<h2 class="callout">Subject of This Lab</h2>
<p>The Subject of this lab is to experiment with CSS selectors.</p>

<h2 class="callout">Challenges</h2>
<p>While completing this lab, I had trouble with styling an element
inside of another. I wasn't sure what elements I should use and what
was the best thing to style it with.</p>

<h2 class="callout">Results</h2>
<p>I fixed this problem by deciding to style heading 1 font color
and highlight color. Since I nested a tag within another in the html
file, I realized that I could use them both and style one within the other.</p>
