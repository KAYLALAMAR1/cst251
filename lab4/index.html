    <h1> Lab 4: File Transfer</h1>
    <h2> The Subject of This Lab</h2>
    <p> The purpose of this lab was to test and upload our
    local files to the server.</p>
    <h2> Challenges</h2>
    <p> During the lab, I had trouble with adding images to the index
     file. The webpage was not loading the image because there was an
    error in the code. Also, the image was displayed at the end of the paragraph
  instead of below.</p>
    <h2> Results</h2>
    <p> To solve this design challenge, here's what I did. For the image
       code problem, I compared my code that wasn't working to the other
       image codes I wrote and fixed it. Af for the error with the
       allignment, I looked at the example code Wes used on a past lab
      and realized he used a divider tag. I swiftly used the tag and my images
      began to allign properly on the page.
