  <p>I like to play video games and watch anime in my spare time.
    I recently watched Great Pretender and Black Clover. I enjoy
    playing Black Desert and my classes are Lahn and Tamer. My favorite
    broadway musical is Wicked and I have two cats and a dog.</p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>During this lab, I had a little trouble with picking out a color
      scheme for the webpage. I wanted something that didn't clash and was
     readable, but also aesthetically pleasing.</p>

      <div id="content">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>I was able to fix this problem by finding a color pallete
        generator online. I used it to pick out some color that go well
      together.</p>
