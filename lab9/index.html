  <h2>Subject of This Lab</h2>
  <p>The subject of this lab is to use a css file to style a webpage
  by modifying the margins, padding, border, and color.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="content">
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>While completing this lab I had trouble with centering my image.
  I tried setting the left and right margins to auto, but it wasn't
working.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="content">
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>I fixed this issue by entering the amount of pixels for both the left
  and right margins. After changing the image size, I increased and
  decreased the values until the image was centered.</p>
