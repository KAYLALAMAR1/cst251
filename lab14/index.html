        <p>The subject of this lab is to use block level and typography
          css to replicate a more challenging webpage.</p>

    <div id="content">
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>During this lab, I had some difficulties with trying to get the text
      that says "on the beach or on a hike" to be in the right position. It's
    supposed to be right above the "75%", but it only stayed at the top of the page.
  I tried multiple things, however none of them worked because whenever I tried
to move it downwards, all of the text on the page moved downwards as well. So the
distance between the text I was trying to move and the "75%" never closed.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="content">
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>After searching for answers for a couple of days, I finally came across
        a solution. I completely forgot about "position: absoute" and was
      struggling because of this one thing. So I put it in my css, then changed
    the margins and everything started working. I was able to replicate the
  the spotify page after fixing this problem. </p>
