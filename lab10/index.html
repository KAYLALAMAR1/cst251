  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>While completeing this lab, I struggled with finding new fonts that
   are compatible with the user's device. I wanted to use fonts like
 Poiret, Lobster, or Fugaz. But it's not just these that didn't work,
 most of them didn't work either. I found these while browsing Google
 Fonts, so I was confused as to why they werent working.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="content">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>I decided to fix this problem by using the only font I got to work
  which was Roboto. Since the intrusctions said to only change the font
  of the body text, I changed that from Futura to Roboto and kept the headings
   as Shrikhand.</p>
