		<p>My name is Kayla Lamar. I am a
			1st year Communication Design major with
			a focus in game design. I really enjoy
			being creative and applying it to my work.
			My interests include drawing and playing
			playing video games. In my spare time, I often
			open my sketchbook and play some music. Although
			I listen to a lot of different music genres, my
			favorite would be alternative. This is a music
			genre I listened to a lot growing up. But I also
			listen to other genres like hip-hop, r&b, pop,
			kpop, disco, EDM, soul, singer/songwriter, OSTs,
			etc. While we have to remain virtual for now,
			I am super excited to move back into campus
			and see everyone whenever that may be.
	   This semester I am very excited to learn
		how to code so I can have the ability to
	make my own web page. I hope to use my new
found web development knowledge to also create
a custom web page for my future career so I can
add the page to my portfolio or add my portfolio
to the page.</p>
