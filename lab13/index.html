        <h2>Subject of This Lab</h2>
        <p>The subject of this lab is to use block level and typography
          css to replicate an existing webpage.</p>
      </div>

    <div id="content">
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>During this lab, I did not have many difficulties. I did have a little
      bit of trouble with centering and sizing the text so it would be very
      close to the original.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="content">
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>This minor issue was quickly fixed I changed the font size and
        margins to resemble the original webpage.</p>
