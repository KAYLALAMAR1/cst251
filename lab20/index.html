<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>While doing the lab, it was a challenge to make 15 sketches that are
  completely different from one another. I feel like I ran out of ideas
sooner than I thought I would. So it was definetly a challnge to create some
diverse prototype designs, but I eventually pulled through.</p>

  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>With this lab, I didn't really have any problems. I knew what to do with
    the html and css so that part was easy. I comlpleted the prototype sketches
    so that wasn't too difficult, although it definetly was a challenge.</p>
