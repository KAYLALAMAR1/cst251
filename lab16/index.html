    <h2>Challenges</h2>
<p class="columns">While doing this lab, I struggled with adding a background image to my divs.
I followed the code in the lecture slides and on w3schools, but non of them
worked. I tried many things including changing the div ids's, adding quotation
marks, and even using a completely new image. Nothing worked so I was really
confused as to what I was doing wrong.</p>

<div id="content">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p class="columns">This problem was fixed when I came across another webpage that said a html
  directory would help. So I followed the example that was provided and the
image finally started working.</p>
