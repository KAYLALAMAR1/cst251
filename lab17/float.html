  <h2>Challenge</h2>
  <p>It was a challenge to decide which layout I wanted to use. I couldn't
    really decide on what would look best using the float style. I tried out
  different positions, sizes, and orders before finally choosing one. I used
  float to put the section on the right side of the page, while aside, footer,
and nav stays on the left side of the page.</p>

  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>I had a few problems while completing this part of the lab. These problems
  were caused by the paragraph and links not appearing with the CSS styling I
  used in the code. Even though I linked the CSS file where I entered the styling, it still
  was not working correctly.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Turns out, the reason that the font and link text decorations weren't working
   was because I forgot to put the curly brackets at the end of the element I
   styled above. I quickly fixed this error and everything started working
 properly. However, the changed did mess up the layout I had already organized,
so I had to change some things around. This includes the box sizes, font color,
and image positioning.</p>
