    <h2> Subject of This Lab</h2>
    <p>The subject of this lab is to create a new index page and
     style it using our own CSS.</p>
    <h2> Challenges</h2>
    <p>I had some trouble with figuring out what fonts worked
    with the css file. There were certain fonts I wanted to try, but didn't
   work.
    <h2> Results</h2>
    <p>I searched for compatible sans-serif font families, and found that
    Trebuchet, Lucida, and Georgia worked well. </p>
