<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p> Kayla and Nely are both Communication
  Design Majors and partners for lab 2.
Nely's focus is web design and Kayla's focus
is game design. Neither of them have experience
in coding prior to taking CST251, but Nely and
Kayla are very interested in learning how to
code this semester. Although the content in the
lectures are completely new, they are sure to
apply the newfound knowledge to their work
and show what they have learned. The two students
are working very diligently to complete the lab and help
each other through collaboration. Whenever they
are confused about the lab, they never hesitate
to contact the professor and ask questions so they
can succeed. Even when the assignment may seem
challenging at first, they always pull through
and submit their results in detail. Nely and
Kayla will be working very hard this semester
to advance their skills.</p>
